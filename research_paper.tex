\begin{abstract}
The proliferation of medical imaging data has created unprecedented opportunities for machine learning applications in healthcare. However, privacy regulations and data silos across healthcare institutions pose significant challenges to centralized model training. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution, enabling collaborative model training without data sharing. However, traditional FL systems still face privacy vulnerabilities and centralization concerns. This paper presents a novel framework that integrates Homomorphic Encryption (HE) with blockchain technology to create a secure, decentralized federated learning system for medical image analysis. Our approach, termed Blockchain-enabled Federated Homomorphic Learning (B-FH-FL), addresses the limitations of conventional FL by providing end-to-end encryption of model updates and eliminating the need for a trusted central server. We implement and evaluate our framework on a real-world medical imaging dataset comprising lung and pneumonia images from multiple hospitals. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves comparable accuracy to centralized training while providing strong privacy guarantees through CKKS homomorphic encryption and ensuring auditability through blockchain-based logging. The framework achieves 87.54\% accuracy on lung disease detection and 89.76\% on pneumonia classification while maintaining differential privacy with $\epsilon=5.0$ and $\delta=1e-5$. Our implementation shows that the computational overhead of homomorphic encryption is manageable, with encryption time averaging 5.2 seconds per model update, making it practical for real-world healthcare applications. The comprehensive security analysis demonstrates resilience against various attack vectors, while the blockchain-based audit trail provides unprecedented transparency and compliance capabilities for healthcare applications.

\section{Introduction}

The exponential growth of medical imaging data has revolutionized healthcare diagnostics, with machine learning models achieving remarkable accuracy in disease detection and classification. However, the centralized approach to model training faces significant challenges in the healthcare domain due to strict privacy regulations such as HIPAA, GDPR, and various national healthcare data protection laws. These regulations prohibit the sharing of patient data across institutional boundaries, creating data silos that limit the potential of machine learning in healthcare.

Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these challenges by enabling collaborative model training without requiring data to leave the premises of participating institutions. In traditional FL, a central server orchestrates the learning process by distributing a global model to clients, who train it on their local data and return model updates (typically gradients or weights). The server then aggregates these updates to improve the global model.

However, conventional FL systems suffer from several critical limitations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Privacy Vulnerabilities}: While raw data remains local, model updates can reveal sensitive information about the training data through various inference attacks, including membership inference, model inversion, and gradient leakage attacks.
    \item \textbf{Centralization Risks}: The central server represents a single point of failure and requires complete trust from all participants, which contradicts the decentralized nature of healthcare institutions.
    \item \textbf{Lack of Auditability}: There is no transparent mechanism to verify the integrity of model updates or track the contribution of each participant.
    \item \textbf{Incentive Misalignment}: Traditional FL lacks mechanisms to incentivize participation or ensure fair contribution from all parties.
\end{enumerate}

To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that synergistically combines two powerful technologies: Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Blockchain. Our approach, termed Blockchain-enabled Federated Homomorphic Learning (B-FH-FL), provides:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{End-to-End Privacy}: CKKS homomorphic encryption ensures that model updates remain encrypted throughout the entire aggregation process, preventing any party from learning about individual contributions.
    \item \textbf{Decentralization}: Blockchain technology eliminates the need for a trusted central server by providing a distributed, immutable ledger for model management and audit trails.
    \item \textbf{Transparency and Auditability}: All model updates and their metadata are recorded on the blockchain, providing an immutable audit trail that can be verified by all participants.
    \item \textbf{Security and Integrity}: Cryptographic hashing and blockchain consensus mechanisms ensure the integrity of the global model and prevent tampering.
\end{itemize}

The main contributions of this paper are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A novel, fully decentralized architecture for federated learning that integrates homomorphic encryption with blockchain technology, eliminating the need for a trusted central server.
    \item A comprehensive protocol that uses smart contracts to manage secure aggregation of encrypted model updates, model versioning, and maintain an immutable audit trail.
    \item A detailed security analysis demonstrating how the framework provides confidentiality, integrity, and auditability, surpassing conventional FL systems.
    \item An empirical evaluation on real-world medical imaging data, demonstrating the practical feasibility and performance characteristics of the proposed approach.
    \item Implementation of differential privacy mechanisms to provide additional privacy guarantees beyond homomorphic encryption.
    \item A comprehensive analysis of regulatory compliance and healthcare-specific security requirements.
    \item Detailed performance benchmarks and scalability analysis for real-world deployment scenarios.
\end{enumerate}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II provides background on federated learning, homomorphic encryption, and blockchain technology. Section III presents our proposed B-FH-FL framework in detail. Section IV analyzes the security and privacy properties of our approach. Section V presents experimental results and performance evaluation. Section VI discusses related work, Section VII provides a comprehensive regulatory compliance analysis, Section VIII presents detailed implementation considerations, and Section IX concludes with future directions.

\section{Background and Related Work}

\subsection{Federated Learning}

Federated Learning (FL) was first introduced by McMahan et al. \cite{mcmahan2017communication} as a paradigm for training machine learning models across decentralized data sources without requiring data to be centralized. The most common algorithm is Federated Averaging (FedAvg), where in each round:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The central server distributes the current global model to all participating clients
    \item Each client trains the model on their local data for multiple epochs
    \item Clients send their updated model weights back to the server
    \item The server aggregates the updates (typically by weighted averaging) to produce the next global model
\end{enumerate}

While FL has shown promise in various domains, including healthcare \cite{li2020federated}, mobile computing \cite{hard2018federated}, and IoT \cite{wang2020federated}, it faces several challenges:

\textbf{Privacy Concerns}: Recent research has demonstrated that model updates can leak sensitive information about training data. Zhu et al. \cite{zhu2019deep} showed that gradients can be used to reconstruct training images, while Melis et al. \cite{melis2019exploiting} demonstrated membership inference attacks on FL systems.

\textbf{Communication Overhead}: FL requires frequent communication between clients and the server, which can be bandwidth-intensive and costly, especially for large models.

\textbf{System Heterogeneity}: Real-world FL deployments must handle varying computational capabilities, network conditions, and data distributions across clients.

\subsection{Homomorphic Encryption}

Homomorphic Encryption (HE) allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data without decryption. A scheme is additively homomorphic if:

\begin{equation}
E(x) \cdot E(y) = E(x + y)
\end{equation}

where $E$ is the encryption function. This property is particularly suitable for federated learning, as the primary aggregation operation is summing model updates.

Several HE schemes have been developed, ranging from partially homomorphic (supporting limited operations) to fully homomorphic (supporting arbitrary computations). For FL applications, Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE) schemes like Paillier \cite{paillier1999public} are often preferred due to their computational efficiency.

The CKKS (Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song) scheme \cite{cheon2017homomorphic} is a leveled homomorphic encryption scheme that supports approximate arithmetic on real numbers, making it particularly suitable for machine learning applications. CKKS allows for:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Addition and multiplication of encrypted values
    \item Approximate computation with controlled precision loss
    \item Efficient encoding of real numbers
    \item Relatively fast encryption and decryption operations
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Blockchain Technology}

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that ensures data immutability and transparency through cryptographic hashing and decentralized consensus mechanisms. Key features relevant to federated learning include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Immutability}: Once recorded, data cannot be altered without detection
    \item \textbf{Transparency}: All participants can verify the integrity of the ledger
    \item \textbf{Decentralization}: No single point of failure or control
    \item \textbf{Smart Contracts}: Self-executing code that can automate complex workflows
\end{itemize}

Several works have proposed using blockchain to decentralize federated learning \cite{kim2019blockchain, weng2019deepchain, li2019blockchain}. These approaches primarily focus on auditability and incentivization, but often lack strong privacy guarantees.

\subsection{Related Work}

The intersection of federated learning, homomorphic encryption, and blockchain has received increasing attention in recent years. Truex et al. \cite{truex2019hybrid} proposed a hybrid approach combining FL with secure multiparty computation, while Li et al. \cite{li2019blockchain} explored blockchain-based FL for IoT applications.

However, most existing approaches either focus on privacy or decentralization, but not both. Our work is the first to propose a comprehensive framework that addresses both concerns simultaneously through the integration of homomorphic encryption and blockchain technology.

\section{Proposed Framework: B-FH-FL}

\subsection{System Architecture}

Our Blockchain-enabled Federated Homomorphic Learning (B-FH-FL) framework consists of three main components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Clients}: Healthcare institutions (e.g., hospitals) that possess local medical imaging data for training. Each client is also a node in the blockchain network.
    \item \textbf{Blockchain Network}: A permissioned blockchain that maintains the global model state and executes smart contracts for model aggregation and management.
    \item \textbf{Smart Contracts}: A set of contracts deployed on the blockchain to manage the entire FL lifecycle, including client registration, key management, model aggregation, and audit logging.
\end{enumerate}

The overall architecture is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:architecture}.

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{System Architecture of B-FH-FL Framework}
\label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Protocol Workflow}

The learning process is divided into rounds, each managed by smart contracts and consisting of the following steps:

\subsubsection{Initialization Phase}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A lead organization deploys the main smart contract, defining the ML model architecture and training hyperparameters.
    \item An additively homomorphic key pair $(PK, SK)$ is generated using the CKKS scheme.
    \item The public key $PK$ is published to the smart contract, while the private key $SK$ is securely distributed to all registered and verified clients.
    \item Clients register with the blockchain network and receive their unique identifiers.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Training Round}

For each round $t$, the following steps are executed:

\textbf{Step 1: Model Distribution}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each client downloads the current encrypted global model $W_t^{enc}$ from the blockchain.
    \item Clients decrypt the model using the shared private key $SK$ to obtain $W_t$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Step 2: Local Training and Encryption}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each client $i$ trains the model on their local data $D_i$ for multiple epochs.
    \item The client computes a model update $\Delta W_{t,i}$.
    \item Before submission, the client encrypts the update using the public key:
    \begin{equation}
    \Delta W_{t,i}^{enc} = E(\Delta W_{t,i}, PK)
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Step 3: On-Chain Secure Aggregation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clients submit their encrypted updates $\Delta W_{t,i}^{enc}$ as transactions to the smart contract.
    \item Once a sufficient number of updates are received, the smart contract performs homomorphic aggregation:
    \begin{equation}
    \sum \Delta W_t^{enc} = \prod_i \Delta W_{t,i}^{enc} = E(\sum_i \Delta W_{t,i}, PK)
    \end{equation}
    \item The contract updates the global model by adding the aggregated update to the previous model weights (also performed homomorphically).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Step 4: Global Model Finalization}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The new encrypted global model $W_{t+1}^{enc}$ is finalized and its hash is recorded in a new block.
    \item This creates an immutable and verifiable record of the model's evolution.
    \item Clients can then pull the new model to begin the next training round.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Smart Contract Implementation}

We implement the core functionality through smart contracts written in Solidity. The main contract includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Client Registration}: Manages participant enrollment and verification
    \item \textbf{Model Management}: Handles model versioning and state transitions
    \item \textbf{Secure Aggregation}: Performs homomorphic operations on encrypted updates
    \item \textbf{Audit Logging}: Records all operations for transparency and compliance
\end{itemize}

The smart contract structure is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:smart_contract}.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Smart Contract for B-FH-FL}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]

\State \textbf{struct} UpdateLog \{
\State \quad string hospitalId;
\State \quad string modelHash;
\State \quad string timestamp;
\State \quad string epoch;

\State \quad string accuracy;
\State \}

\State
\Function{logUpdate}{hospitalId, modelHash, timestamp, epoch, datasetSlice, accuracy}
    \State updates.push(UpdateLog(
        hospitalId,
        modelHash,
        timestamp,
        epoch,
        datasetSlice,
        accuracy
    ))
\EndFunction

\State
\Function{getUpdate}{index} \textbf{returns} UpdateLog
    \State \Return updates[index]
\EndFunction

\State
\Function{getTotalUpdates}{} \textbf{returns} uint
    \State \Return updates.length
\EndFunction

\end{algorithmic}
\label{alg:smart_contract}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms}

\subsubsection{Homomorphic Encryption with CKKS}

We employ the CKKS scheme for encrypting model updates. CKKS is particularly suitable for our use case because:

\begin{itemize}
    \item It supports approximate arithmetic on real numbers, which is sufficient for machine learning applications
    \item It provides efficient encoding and decoding operations
    \item It allows for controlled precision loss, which can be tuned based on application requirements
\end{itemize}

The encryption process for model weights $w$ is:

\begin{equation}
c = E(w, PK) = \text{CKKS\_Encrypt}(w, PK)
\end{equation}

And the homomorphic addition of encrypted updates:

\begin{equation}
c_{sum} = \prod_{i=1}^{n} c_i = E(\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i, PK)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Mathematical Formulation of B-FH-FL}

The B-FH-FL framework can be mathematically formulated as follows:

\textbf{Problem Definition}: Given $K$ healthcare institutions with local datasets $\{D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_K\}$, where each $D_i = \{(x_j^{(i)}, y_j^{(i)})\}_{j=1}^{n_i}$, we aim to learn a global model $W^*$ that minimizes the empirical risk:

\begin{equation}
W^* = \arg\min_W \sum_{i=1}^{K} \frac{n_i}{N} \mathcal{L}_i(W)
\end{equation}

where $N = \sum_{i=1}^{K} n_i$ and $\mathcal{L}_i(W) = \frac{1}{n_i} \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} \ell(f_W(x_j^{(i)}), y_j^{(i)})$ is the local loss function.

\textbf{Secure Aggregation Protocol}: In each round $t$, the secure aggregation protocol proceeds as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Each client $i$ computes local gradients: $\nabla \mathcal{L}_i(W_t)$
    \item Client $i$ encrypts the gradients: $c_i^{(t)} = E(\nabla \mathcal{L}_i(W_t), PK)$
    \item Homomorphic aggregation: $c_{sum}^{(t)} = \prod_{i=1}^{K} c_i^{(t)} = E(\sum_{i=1}^{K} \nabla \mathcal{L}_i(W_t), PK)$
    \item Global model update: $W_{t+1} = W_t - \eta \cdot D(c_{sum}^{(t)}, SK)$
\end{enumerate}

where $D(\cdot, SK)$ denotes decryption with the private key $SK$.

\subsubsection{Differential Privacy Implementation}

We implement differential privacy using the Gaussian mechanism. For a function $f: \mathcal{D} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$, the Gaussian mechanism adds noise drawn from $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I)$ where:

\begin{equation}
\sigma = \frac{\Delta f \sqrt{2 \ln(1.25/\delta)}}{\epsilon}
\end{equation}

and $\Delta f$ is the $L_2$ sensitivity of $f$.

The differentially private gradient computation becomes:

\begin{equation}
\tilde{g}_i = \nabla \mathcal{L}_i(W) + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I)
\end{equation}



\subsubsection{Smart Contract Algorithm}

Algorithm \ref{alg:federated_learning} presents the complete federated learning protocol:

\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage{algpseudocode}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{B-FH-FL Protocol}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]

\State \textbf{Input:} Global model $W_0$, learning rate $\eta$, number of rounds $T$
\State \textbf{Output:} Final global model $W_T$

\For{$t = 1$ to $T$}
    \State \textbf{// Model Distribution Phase}
    \State Broadcast $W_{t-1}^{enc}$ to all clients

    \For{each client $i$}
        \State $W_{t-1}^{(i)} = D(W_{t-1}^{enc}, SK)$
        
        \State \textbf{// Local Training Phase}
        \State $\nabla \mathcal{L}_i = \text{ComputeGradients}(W_{t-1}^{(i)}, D_i)$
        \State $\tilde{g}_i = \nabla \mathcal{L}_i + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I)$ \Comment{Add DP noise}
        \State $c_i^{(t)} = E(\tilde{g}_i, PK)$ \Comment{Encrypt gradients}
        \State Submit $c_i^{(t)}$ to smart contract
    \EndFor

    \State \textbf{// Secure Aggregation Phase}
    \State $c_{sum}^{(t)} = \prod_{i=1}^{K} c_i^{(t)}$ \Comment{Homomorphic aggregation}
    \State $\tilde{g}_{sum}^{(t)} = D(c_{sum}^{(t)}, SK)$
    \State $W_t = W_{t-1} - \eta \cdot \tilde{g}_{sum}^{(t)}$
    \State $W_t^{enc} = E(W_t, PK)$
    \State Record $W_t^{enc}$ hash on blockchain
\EndFor

\State \Return $W_T$

\end{algorithmic}
\label{alg:federated_learning}
\end{algorithm}


\subsubsection{Differential Privacy}

In addition to homomorphic encryption, we implement differential privacy to provide additional privacy guarantees. We use the Opacus library to add calibrated noise to gradients during training:

\begin{equation}
\tilde{g} = g + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I)
\end{equation}

where $\sigma$ is calibrated to achieve the desired privacy budget $(\epsilon, \delta)$.

\section{Security and Privacy Analysis}

\subsection{Privacy Guarantees}

Our B-FH-FL framework provides multiple layers of privacy protection:

\textbf{Confidentiality through Homomorphic Encryption}: Individual model updates remain encrypted throughout the entire aggregation process. Even if an adversary gains access to the blockchain or smart contract, they cannot learn anything about specific clients' contributions beyond what can be inferred from the aggregated result.

\textbf{Differential Privacy}: The addition of calibrated noise ensures that the presence or absence of any individual data point cannot be determined with high confidence, providing protection against membership inference attacks.

\textbf{Local Data Protection}: Raw training data never leaves the premises of participating institutions, ensuring compliance with healthcare privacy regulations.

\subsection{Integrity and Auditability}

\textbf{Blockchain Immutability}: All model updates and their metadata are recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable audit trail. Any attempt to tamper with historical records would be immediately detectable.

\textbf{Cryptographic Verification}: Model updates are cryptographically hashed before being recorded, allowing for integrity verification at any time.

\textbf{Transparent Aggregation}: The smart contract code is publicly visible and verifiable, ensuring that all participants can verify the correctness of the aggregation process.

\subsection{Security Analysis}

We analyze the security of our framework against various attack vectors:

\textbf{Model Inversion Attacks}: Homomorphic encryption prevents adversaries from accessing individual model updates, making model inversion attacks infeasible. The CKKS scheme provides semantic security, ensuring that encrypted model updates reveal no information about the underlying parameters.

\textbf{Membership Inference}: Differential privacy provides theoretical guarantees against membership inference attacks, while homomorphic encryption prevents direct access to model parameters. The combination of both mechanisms provides strong protection against membership inference.

\textbf{Data Poisoning}: While our framework does not directly prevent data poisoning, the transparency of the blockchain allows for detection and mitigation of such attacks through audit trails. We implement anomaly detection mechanisms to identify suspicious model updates.

\textbf{Consensus Attacks}: The permissioned nature of our blockchain network and the requirement for consensus among healthcare institutions make consensus attacks highly unlikely in practice. The PBFT consensus mechanism ensures Byzantine fault tolerance.

\textbf{Man-in-the-Middle Attacks}: All communications are encrypted using TLS/SSL protocols, and the blockchain provides integrity verification for all transactions.

\textbf{Replay Attacks}: Each transaction includes a unique timestamp and nonce, preventing replay attacks on the blockchain network.

\subsection{Formal Security Analysis}

\subsubsection{Cryptographic Security}

We provide formal security analysis for the CKKS homomorphic encryption scheme:

\textbf{Semantic Security}: The CKKS scheme provides semantic security under the Ring-Learning With Errors (RLWE) assumption. For any probabilistic polynomial-time adversary $\mathcal{A}$, the advantage in distinguishing between encryptions of two different messages is negligible:

\begin{equation}
|\Pr[\mathcal{A}(E(m_0)) = 1] - \Pr[\mathcal{A}(E(m_1)) = 1]| \leq \text{negl}(\lambda)
\end{equation}

where $\lambda$ is the security parameter.

\textbf{Indistinguishability}: The homomorphic property ensures that the distribution of encrypted sums is indistinguishable from the distribution of individual encryptions:

\begin{equation}
E(\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i) \approx_c \prod_{i=1}^{n} E(m_i)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Differential Privacy Guarantees}

We provide formal guarantees for the differential privacy implementation:

\textbf{Privacy Budget}: The total privacy loss across $T$ rounds is bounded by:

\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{total} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \epsilon_t \leq \epsilon_{target}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Composition Theorem}: The advanced composition theorem ensures that the privacy loss scales as $O(\sqrt{T \log(1/\delta)})$ rather than linearly with the number of rounds.

\subsubsection{Blockchain Security}

\textbf{Immutability}: The blockchain provides computational immutability under the assumption that the majority of computational power is honest. The probability of successfully modifying a block decreases exponentially with the number of confirmations.

\textbf{Consensus Security}: The PBFT consensus mechanism ensures that if at most $f$ out of $3f+1$ nodes are Byzantine, the system maintains safety and liveness properties.

\subsection{Threat Model and Risk Assessment}

\subsubsection{Adversary Capabilities}

We consider adversaries with the following capabilities:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Computational Power}: Adversaries have access to polynomial-time computational resources
    \item \textbf{Network Access}: Adversaries can intercept and modify network communications
    \item \textbf{Insider Access}: Some adversaries may have insider access to participating institutions
    \item \textbf{Blockchain Access}: Adversaries can read all blockchain data and potentially participate in consensus
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Risk Assessment Matrix}

Table \ref{tab:risk_assessment} presents a comprehensive risk assessment:

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Security Risk Assessment Matrix}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}

Model Inversion & Low & High & Medium \\
\hline
Membership Inference & Medium & Medium & Medium \\
\hline
Data Poisoning & Medium & High & High \\
\hline
Consensus Attack & Low & High & Medium \\
\hline
Key Compromise & Low & Critical & High \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{tab:risk_assessment}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Mitigation Strategies}

For each identified risk, we implement appropriate mitigation strategies:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model Inversion}: Homomorphic encryption and differential privacy provide strong protection
    \item \textbf{Membership Inference}: Differential privacy with carefully calibrated noise parameters
    \item \textbf{Data Poisoning}: Anomaly detection and blockchain-based audit trails
    \item \textbf{Consensus Attack}: Permissioned blockchain with trusted healthcare institutions
    \item \textbf{Key Compromise}: Hierarchical key management with backup and recovery procedures
\end{itemize}

\section{Experimental Evaluation}
